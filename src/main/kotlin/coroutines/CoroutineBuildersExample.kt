        CoroutineContext
        The CoroutineContext is a set of elements that define the behavior of a coroutine.
        It’s made of:
        Job — controls the lifecycle of the coroutine.
        CoroutineDispatcher — dispatches work to the appropriate thread.
        CoroutineName — name of the coroutine, useful for debugging.
        CoroutineExceptionHandler — handles uncaught exceptions, will be covered in Part 3 of the series.
